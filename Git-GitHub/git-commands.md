## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks all the changes that are made to a project and that lets you view the h√≠story of changes and recover earlier versions of the project.

Git makes use of repositories. A repository is a collection of all files and folders that are associated with a project.  
Everytime you make changes in the repo and commit those changes, git will take a snapshot of the repo.  
A git repo will track all the commits that are made.

## Git commands

"git init"  
initalizes a new git repo. A hidden subfolder called git will be added, to keek track of all the changes.

"git clone"
creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely.

"git add"  
stages a change (Unclear what is staging?)

"git commit"
saves a snapshot of the repo and adds it to the tracked changes.

"git branch"  
shows all local branches (git branch -a also shows remote branches).

"git merge"  
combines changes in different branches

"git pull"  
uodates the local repo with changes from the remote repo.

"git push"
