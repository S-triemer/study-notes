# Github Workflow

## Get an existing repository

To get a copy of an existing repository, you can clone it or fork it.

### clone a repository

To clone a repository you can use "git clone url" and use the url or SSH Key of the repo that you want to clone.  
You can push all your changes directly to the remote repo from your local repo. Because of that, this method can only be used, if you have write access to the repo.

### fork a repo

If you have no write access to a repo, you can fork the github repo, which will make a copy of the repo inside your own github account.  
The parent repo is refered to as upstream and the forked copy is refered to as origin.  
You can than clone the copy to your local pc, make changes to the copy and than send a pull request to get your copies changes merged with upstream.
